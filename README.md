# Kyanite
The Kyanite Programming Language

  Kyanite is a programming language designed to combine aspects of Java, Crystal/Ruby, Python, and whatever else seems useful. Basically, the language is designed to be useful without having a Gigatonne learning curve.
  If you are interested in the Gemstone Kyanite, here is a link to some information about it:http://www.minerals.net/gemstone/kyanite_gemstone.aspx
  
NOTE: Much of the code will be copied from other programming language repositories at least at first. I am still learning after all.
